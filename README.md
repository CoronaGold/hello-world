# hello-world
this is my github debut
I am CoronaGold.  I got my name one day when I was signing up for yet another website and I needed a username.  I was tired of each website telling me "that name is already taken."  So I decided to find a name that would likely be available wherever I went.  I was drinking a Corona at the time while I studied the stock market, so I was thinking about money and when I looked at my bottle of beer I saw the golden color of the brew.  CoronaGold was born.
